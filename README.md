# ADC-LEDs
This project aims to read the analog voltage sinusoidal signal as input and output the voltage frequency value to digital ports to show the result as a hex value by turning on the corresponding LEDs.
Proteus is used to simulate the circuitry and CCS C Compiler to create and compile the code for the project.
The .hex file is obtained after compiling the code in CCS C Compiler and is given to the PIC18F25K22 microcontroller.
